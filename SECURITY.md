## Reporting security vulnerabilities

Report sensitive security issues privately (for example via GitHub Security Advisories or maintainer contact from the repository homepage) rather than in public issues. Include reproduction steps and affected versions when possible.

This project implements comprehensive security scanning using multiple tools to ensure code quality and security.

## Security Tools

### 1. TruffleHog
- **Purpose**: Detect and prevent secrets in git repos

### 2. Gosec
- **Purpose**: Go security checker
- **Usage**: `make gosec`
- **Output**: `gosec-report.json`

### 3. Trivy
- **Purpose**: Vulnerability scanner for containers and filesystems
- **Config**: `.trivyignore`
- **Usage**: `make trivy`

### 4. Semgrep
- **Purpose**: Static analysis tool
- **Config**: `.semgrep.yml`
- **Usage**: `make semgrep`

### 5. Pre-commit Hooks
- **Config**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- **Includes**:
  - Gitleaks for secret scanning
  - Go formatting and linting
  - Detect-secrets baseline
  - File fixes and checks

## Quick Start

1. **Install all security tools**:
   ```bash
   make install-security-tools
   ```

2. **Set up pre-commit hooks**:
   ```bash
   make pre-commit-install
   ```

3. **Generate secrets baseline**:
   ```bash
   make generate-secrets-baseline
   ```

## Running Security Scans

### Quick scan (development):
```bash
make quick-scan
```

### Full security scan:
```bash
make security-check
```

### All checks (test + security):
```bash
make check
```

### Manual pre-commit run:
```bash
make pre-commit-run
```

## GitHub Actions Integration

The `.github/workflows/security.yml` workflow runs automatically on:
- Push to main/develop branches
- Pull requests
- Weekly schedule (Sunday midnight)

It includes:
- Gitleaks secret scanning
- Gosec security analysis
- Trivy vulnerability scanning
- Semgrep static analysis
- CodeQL analysis
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- License compliance
- SBOM generation

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables or secret management tools
2. **Run pre-commit hooks** - Catches issues before they're committed
3. **Review security reports** - Check GitHub Security tab regularly
4. **Keep dependencies updated** - Use `go mod tidy` and update regularly
5. **Follow secure coding practices** - See `.semgrep.yml` for common patterns to avoid

## Handling Security Issues

1. **If a secret is detected**:
   - Immediately revoke the compromised credential
   - Remove from git history if needed
   - Update `.gitleaks.toml` allowlist if false positive

2. **If vulnerabilities are found**:
   - Review the severity and impact
   - Update dependencies if patches available
   - Add to `.trivyignore` if risk accepted (with justification)

3. **For false positives**:
   - Update tool configurations to exclude
   - Document the reason for exclusion
   - Regularly review exclusions

## Local Development

Before pushing code:
```bash
# Run quick security scan
make quick-scan

# Run full test suite
make test

# Or run everything
make all
```
